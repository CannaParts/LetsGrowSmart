                 Do What The Fuck You Want With It

 The licensor expects that his/her/their published knowledge/software/
       hardware could lower the CO2 we leave to our descendants.

       There is nothing more important, for the next centuries,
         than to globally share all knowledge and technologies
     especially if they are usable to run our present and future 
                     with exhausting less CO2.

The licensor just wishes that you "copyleft" all your additional gained
        knowledge/developments/technologies to the world, too!

            You are also free to proprietary your stuff...
               ...then thank you for the CO2 saving!
         But you are still a major part of the problem, too!
                So, get the fuck out of your brain
            you would been more worth or more important
              than the grand kids of your neighbors!

0.1		About the initial Author (Pit)
		------------------------------
		
		"Pit" (Oh please, yes! I'm used to that German "Pit" gets almost
		interpreted as "Pete" - and I'm pretty fine with it!)
		
		Born in 1967 - growing Cannabis since the early 80s.
		Three Kids and actually seven grandchildren.
		
		Educated toolmaker, but most jobs in life were industrial engi-
		neering with a slight focus on Soft- and Hardware development
		over the mechanical constructing.
		
		There may be a way to actually reach me out via Twitter:
		@PeterNorml
		
		All CannaParts-Projects will soon get their repositories on
		Github.
		
		The "brands" CannaControl, CannaClocky, LetsGrow, CannaParts are
		used by me since up to 30 years.
		
		I'm starting this project at a point I went bankrupt and into
		debts caused by much too long supporting a medical cannabis
		project in Denmark - shit happens.
		The left tragedy is that the debts are that hard that I can't
		support and maintain the LetsGrowSmart project the way I should.
		
		If you are a rich guy and you wanna help speeding up to save up
		to 20% - 33% of the CO2 exhausted by cannabis indoor grows...
		...please let me know!

1.1		Florin
		------

		A mix of plant hormones which tells an adult plant if it's 
		time to flower or to stay in vegetative state.
		All Cannabis, but not "Ruderalis" aka "Automatics" starts the
		production of Florin primary depending on the ratio of day to
		night time they got within the previous day&night-cycles.


1.2		Day&Night / SDay&SNight / Week & SWeek / Cycles (S = Smart)
		-----------------------------------------------------------
		
		The core of the LetsGrowSmart knowledge is unchain your mind and
		technology from the earth given "Day".
		
		The "Day" and "Night" taking each one flexible part of 24h.
		Depending on your latitude and the season you will get day to
		night time ratios in between 00h : 24h and 24h : 00h.
		Just the guys on the equator can enjoy the whole year from a day
		to night ratio from 12h : 12h.
		Cannabis (like almost all other "one year plants" too) can
		naturally procreate on the latitudes between "Spitsbergen" and
		"Patagonia" - but best natural locations seem much closer to the
		equator than to Spitsbergen.

		The "SNight" is long enough to have a perfect resting time and
		to (not) wake up with Florin.
		The "SDay" is not longer than the plant can do efficient
		photosynthesis before the need to rest.  
		To generate SDays&SNights is at least a smart time-switch needed
		which knows about the actual state and the real needs of the
		plant.

        A week is 7 Days.
        
        SWeeks are flexible with a real duration from ~4 to ~6 Days.
        
        The age of a plant depends almost on the sum of day&night
        cycles. Independent if the cycles are following the 24h model
        or a smarter model.
        
                       
1.3		Seedling
		--------
		
		A plant germinated from seed. Those plants need after
		germination 30-50 Cycles to mature into a state to be able to
		produce Florin.
 

1.4		Cutting
		-------

		5cm to 20cm long "tip" of a matured plant branch.


1.5		Clone
		-----

		A cutting placed on the position (or inside a "system") to get
		roots.
		
		
1.6		Vega
		----
	
		Succesful rooted cuttings and matured seedlings.
		
		
1.7		Flower
		------

		Ex vega plants - from the start of producing florin until the
		day of harvesting.

		
1.8		Sativa
		------

		Bullshit term for more equatorial and more high altitude
		influenced genetics. They almost need longer to mature and to
		flower - when driven within 24h cycles.
		
		
1.9		Indica
		------

		Bullshit term for less equatorial and more low altitude
		influenced genetics. They are almost faster in maturing and much
		faster in flowering within 24h cycles.
		
		
1.10	Ruderalis / "Automatics"
		------------------------

		In opposition to Sativas and Indicas those Cannabis strains make
		their decision to start producing florin primary on their age
		and very independent from the daytime to nighttime ratio.
		LetsGrowSmart can't give you actually any proven advice how to
		speed up vega and flower for those genetics!
		
------------------------------------------------------------------------



							2.0		Timing
							==============


2.1		Generic
		-------

		Relatively independent from being in vega or flower the majority
		of strains can't do more than 8,5h of high efficient photo-
		synthesis within one cycle of day- and nighttime.
		But those 8,5h can't get realized within less than 10,5h -
		11,5h hours. You have to timelap your grow to find the many
		15-30 minutes which sums up to this "lost" 2-3 hours
		where the plants need some clouds more than direct sun.
		
		Also relatively independent from being in vega or flower the
		majority of strains does absolutely not need more than 4,5h of
		resting time to get the metabolic night shift done.
		Just for the optional production of florin you have to add
		around 1,5h to the nighttime within a cycle.
		
		To not destroy the florin during daytime, the daytime can't be
		much longer than the nighttime. But as longer the nighttime is,
		as higher the difference between day- and nighttime can be.
		
		The following timing advises describing a testing scenario where
		Indica and Sativa strains will safe work to show their least
		capabilities within a smarter timing cycle than 24h based
		ones. 
		Just do one room your conventional way and a second room a
		smarter way.
		
		The "Quality" is a very rough estimation how close this setup is
		to the best possible setup. How to get the best setup see 2.5.

		
2.2		Pre Vega
		--------

		As long the plants try to build roots or to establish the first 
		roots there is not a lot metabolic work to do for the plant
		during the night.

								3 or more lamps
					works with		need of	
		  Quality	std. timers	  Sunrise/Set	Day(all On)	Night
		-----------------------------------------------------------
			50%			yes				no		 9,5 (9,5)	 2,5
			66%			yes				yes		 9,5 (7,5)	 2,5
			90%			no				yes		10,5 (8,5)	 2,5


2.3		Vega
		----
		
								3 or more lamps
					works with		need of	
		  Quality	std. timers	  Sunrise/Set	Day(all On)	Night
		-----------------------------------------------------------
			40%			yes				no		 7,5 (7,5)	 4,5
			66%			no				no		 9,5 (9,5)	 4,5
			80%			no				yes		10,5 (8,5)	 4,5


2.4		Flower
		------

								3 or more lamps
					works with		need of	
		  Quality	std. timers	  Sunrise/Set	Day(all On)	Night
		-----------------------------------------------------------
			25%			yes				no		10,5 (10,5)	13,5
			33%			yes				yes		12,5 ( 8,5)	11,5
			75%			no				yes		10,5 ( 8,5)	 9,5


2.5		Sunrise / Sunset / Clouding
		---------------------------

		To be able to reach out higher qualities we must be able to
		simulate sunrise, sunset and clouding. As more lamps you have
		in as bigger rooms as more you can reduce the total need of
		nighttime and as better you can fill the 8,5h photosynthesis
		without the need to waste too much power.
		
		It's a very complex to describe system which need to get
		adjusted to reach out best "qualities". Especially cause it's
		very strain depending.
		In common it'll be easier and more realistic to get a regular
		11-WeeksToFlowerStrain done within 8 weeks than to reduce a
		8-week strain down to 6 weeks. Not the 6 weeks will be the
		problem but there is a point where the costs of quantity loss
		getting greater than the energy savings. This happens earlier
		with "Indica" strains.
