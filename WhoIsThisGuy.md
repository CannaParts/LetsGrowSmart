Born in 1967 - growing Cannabis since the early 80s. Three kids and actually seven grandchildren.  

Educated toolmaker + media-designer (software & print) and instructor for youth and adults inside the German "DualEducationSystem.  
But most jobs in life were initially supposed to be industrial engineering with a slight focus on Soft- and Hardware development over the mechanical constructing - but finally was this never enough and I got a kind of a walking library and toolbox for everyone in need - but principally free just to do what I thought makes the most sense. I had to deep learn a lot technologies and machinery. The time I spent on work I added in privacy to really learn all the things on a rock solid level. With fun! I have to say thanks to every single company I got educated or worked for since I left school in 1985.
				
All ***CannaParts*** projects will soon get their repositories on Github.
		
The "brands" ***CannaControl***, ***CannaClocky***, ***LetsGrow***, ***CannaParts*** are used by me since up to 30 years.
		
I am publishing this at a point I went bankrupt and into debts caused by much too long financially and physically supporting a ~~medical cannabis~~ investment scam project in Denmark - shit happens.
The left tragedy is that the debts are that hard to handle, that I can't support and maintain the ***LetsGrowSmart*** and other ***CannaParts*** projects the way I should.
		
If you are a rich guy and you want to help speeding up to save up to 20% - 33% of the CO2 exhausted by cannabis indoor grows...
